**DEFINITIONS**

- Local Authority (LA) boundaries define the exact geographic limits of a council's jurisdiction.

**SCOPE**

- United Kingdom (England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland).
- 374 LADs.

**CRS**

- EPSG:27700 (British National Grid / BNG).

**LICENCE**

- Open Government Licence v3.0.

**DATA QUALITY CAVEATS**

- Geography keys are NULL on 43 of 374 rows, measured 28 July 2026: 43 are in Scotland or Northern Ireland, outside the England and Wales lookup.
- County and Spatial Development Strategy columns are England and Wales only; rows elsewhere carry no county or SDS. Wales and the Isles of Scilly carry a county but no SDS. Rows with no Local Authority District code are NULL in all four columns.
- `lad25cd` and `lad25nm` cover England and Wales only; Scottish and Northern Irish rows carry no 2025 district code.

**ENRICHMENT**

- `sds_name` / `sds_group` — Spatial Development Strategy area and devolution status, a Prior + Partners categorisation over Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) English devolution policy, joined at load on the row's Local Authority District 2025 code via uk.ref_lad25_ctyua25_sds_lu_jul2026.
