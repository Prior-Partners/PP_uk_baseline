- Flood Zone 3: "Land assessed as having a 1 in 100 or greater annual probability of river flooding (>1%), or a 1 in 200 or greater annual probability of sea flooding (>0.5%) in any year." (EA Flood Map guidance)

MSOA SPLIT (added 3 July 2026)

- Geometry split to one row per (source feature x MSOA 2021). Each row carries that MSOA's msoa21cd / msoa21nm / msoa21hclnm and best-fit lad22 / lad25. The source feature's original primary key is preserved as `source_fid`; `gid` is a fresh surrogate primary key. Features with no MSOA overlap (offshore or outside England & Wales) are kept whole with NULL geography columns.


## Columns

| Column | Type | Description / unit |
|---|---|---|
| `source_fid` | `bigint` | Primary key of the source feature in the pre-split layer uk.env_defra_flood_zones_2_3_river_sea_april2026__preswap_jul03 (non-unique here: a feature spanning N MSOAs has N rows). |
| `id` | `integer` |  |
| `fid_original` | `bigint` |  |
| `origin` | `character varying(64)` |  |
| `flood_zone` | `character varying(3)` |  |
| `flood_source` | `character varying(32)` |  |
| `shape_length` | `double precision` |  |
| `shape_area` | `double precision` |  |
| `area_ha` | `double precision` |  |
| `rgn22cd` | `text` |  |
| `rgn22nm` | `text` |  |
| `sds_boundary` | `text` |  |
| `msoa21cd` | `character varying` | Middle Layer Super Output Area (MSOA) 2021 code of this piece. Open Government Licence v3.0. |
| `msoa21nm` | `character varying` | Official ONS MSOA 2021 name of this piece. Open Government Licence v3.0. |
| `msoa21hclnm` | `text` | House of Commons Library readable MSOA name of this piece. Open Parliament Licence. |
| `lad22cd` | `text` | Local Authority District 2022 code (2021 LAD geography, anchored to the MSOA 2021 name scoping), best-fit from this piece's msoa21cd. Open Government Licence v3.0. |
| `lad22nm` | `text` | Local Authority District 2022 name (2021 LAD geography), best-fit from this piece's msoa21cd. Open Government Licence v3.0. |
| `lad25cd` | `text` | Local Authority District 2025 code (current administering authority), best-fit from this piece's msoa21cd. Open Government Licence v3.0. |
| `lad25nm` | `text` | Local Authority District 2025 name (current administering authority), best-fit from this piece's msoa21cd. Open Government Licence v3.0. |
