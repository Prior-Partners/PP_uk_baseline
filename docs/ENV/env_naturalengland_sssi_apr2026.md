**SOURCE**

- Natural England, via the NE Open Data Hub. Sites of Special Scientific Interest (England) dataset.

**DOCUMENTATION**

- NE Open Data Hub     : https://naturalengland-defra.opendata.arcgis.com/
- gov.uk SSSI guidance : https://www.gov.uk/guidance/protected-areas-sites-of-special-scientific-interest

**DEFINITIONS**

- "Natural England will 'notify' (or designate) the land as a site of special scientific interest (SSSI)" when "it believes the site has features of special interest, such as its: wildlife, geology, landform." (gov.uk, Protected areas: sites of special scientific interest)

**SCOPE**

- England. 8,810 rows across 4,128 distinct reference codes.

**CRS**

- EPSG:27700 (OSGB 1936 / British National Grid). Geometry type MultiPolygon.

**LICENCE**

- Open Government Licence v3.0. © Natural England.

**DATA QUALITY CAVEATS**

- The row count counts split pieces, not source features: this layer was split by Middle Layer Super Output Area, so it holds one row per feature per MSOA piece, plus whole and remainder rows to keep 100% of the source geometry. 8,810 rows represent 4,777 source features, measured 28 July 2026. `source_fid` identifies the originating feature.
- Geography keys are NULL on 489 of 8,810 rows, measured 28 July 2026: 472 fall inside an England or Wales district and could carry one, so their keys are a gap rather than an absence; 9 are residual fragments left by the MSOA split, each under 100 sqm or 10 m; 8 are in Scotland or Northern Ireland, outside the England and Wales lookup.
- County and Spatial Development Strategy columns are England and Wales only; rows elsewhere carry no county or SDS. Wales and the Isles of Scilly carry a county but no SDS. Rows with no Local Authority District code are NULL in all four columns.

**ENRICHMENT**

- `sds_name` / `sds_group` — Spatial Development Strategy area and devolution status, a Prior + Partners categorisation over Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) English devolution policy, joined at load on the row's Local Authority District 2025 code via uk.ref_lad25_ctyua25_sds_lu_jul2026.
- Geometry split to one row per source feature per MSOA (2021).
- Each row carries that MSOA's `msoa21cd`, `msoa21nm`, `msoa21hclnm`, `lad22cd`, `lad22nm`, `lad25cd`, `lad25nm`.
- The source feature's original primary key is preserved as `source_fid`; `gid` is a fresh surrogate primary key.
- Features with no MSOA overlap (offshore or outside England & Wales) are kept whole, with NULL geography columns.
