`env_ncea_peaty_soil_extent_may2025`

**ENRICHMENT**

- Geometry split to one row per source feature per MSOA (2021).
- Each row carries that MSOA's `msoa21cd`, `msoa21nm`, `msoa21hclnm`, `lad22cd`, `lad22nm`, `lad25cd`, `lad25nm`.
- The source feature's original primary key is preserved as `source_fid`; `gid` is a fresh surrogate primary key.
- Features with no MSOA overlap (offshore or outside England & Wales) are kept whole, with NULL geography columns.


## Columns

| Column | Type | Description / unit |
|---|---|---|
| `source_fid` | `integer` | Primary key of the source feature in the pre-split layer uk.env_ncea_peaty_soil_extent_may2025__preswap_jul03 (non-unique here: a feature spanning N MSOAs has N rows). |
| `component_` | `double precision` | Source field `component_`; soil component identifier from the source. |
| `dn` | `double precision` | Source field `dn`; raster class value (DN, digital number) carried through the raster-to-vector conversion. |
| `msoa21cd` | `character varying` | Middle Layer Super Output Area (MSOA) 2021 code of this piece. Open Government Licence v3.0. |
| `msoa21nm` | `character varying` | Official ONS MSOA 2021 name of this piece. Open Government Licence v3.0. |
| `msoa21hclnm` | `text` | House of Commons Library readable MSOA name of this piece. Open Parliament Licence. |
| `lad22cd` | `text` | Local Authority District 2022 code (2021 LAD geography, anchored to the MSOA 2021 name scoping), best-fit from this piece's msoa21cd. Open Government Licence v3.0. |
| `lad22nm` | `text` | Local Authority District 2022 name (2021 LAD geography), best-fit from this piece's msoa21cd. Open Government Licence v3.0. |
| `lad25cd` | `text` | Local Authority District 2025 code (current administering authority), best-fit from this piece's msoa21cd. Open Government Licence v3.0. |
| `lad25nm` | `text` | Local Authority District 2025 name (current administering authority), best-fit from this piece's msoa21cd. Open Government Licence v3.0. |
| `geom` | `geometry(MultiPolygon,27700)` | Peaty soil extent polygon geometry in EPSG:27700 (British National Grid); one part per MSOA (2021) after the split. |
| `gid` | `bigint` | Surrogate primary key, added at the MSOA split (see ENRICHMENT). |
