MSOA SPLIT (added 3 July 2026)

- Geometry split to one row per (source feature x MSOA 2021). Each row carries that MSOA's msoa21cd / msoa21nm / msoa21hclnm and best-fit lad22 / lad25. The source feature's original primary key is preserved as `source_fid`; `gid` is a fresh surrogate primary key. Features with no MSOA overlap (offshore or outside England & Wales) are kept whole with NULL geography columns.
