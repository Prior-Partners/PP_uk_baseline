**DOCUMENTATION**

**DEFINITIONS**

- "Listed buildings are buildings of special architectural or historic interest with legal protection." (Historic England, Listed Buildings)
- Listing grades: Grade I — buildings of exceptional interest; Grade II* — particularly important buildings of more than special interest; Grade II — buildings of special interest. (Historic England, Listed Buildings)

**SCOPE**

- England. 380,263 polygon rows representing 379,329 distinct List Entry Numbers (a small number of buildings have more than one polygon).

**CRS**

- EPSG:27700 (OSGB 1936 / British National Grid). Geometry type MultiPolygon.

**LICENCE**

- Open Government Licence v3.0. © Historic England.

**DATA QUALITY CAVEATS**

- The row count counts split pieces, not source features: this layer was split by Middle Layer Super Output Area, so it holds one row per feature per MSOA piece, plus whole and remainder rows to keep 100% of the source geometry. 381,254 rows represent 380,263 source features, measured 28 July 2026. `source_fid` identifies the originating feature.
- Geography keys are NULL on 8 of 381,254 rows, measured 28 July 2026: 6 are residual fragments left by the MSOA split, each under 100 sqm or 10 m; 2 fall outside every district — offshore, inter-tidal, or beyond Great Britain.
- County and Spatial Development Strategy columns are England and Wales only; rows elsewhere carry no county or SDS. Wales and the Isles of Scilly carry a county but no SDS. Rows with no Local Authority District code are NULL in all four columns.

**ENRICHMENT**

- `sds_name` / `sds_group` — Spatial Development Strategy area and devolution status, a Prior + Partners categorisation over Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) English devolution policy, joined at load on the row's Local Authority District 2025 code via uk.ref_lad25_ctyua25_sds_lu_jul2026.

MSOA SPLIT (added 3 July 2026)

- Geometry split to one row per (source feature x MSOA 2021). Each row carries that MSOA's msoa21cd / msoa21nm / msoa21hclnm and best-fit lad22 / lad25. The source feature's original primary key is preserved as `source_fid`; `gid` is a fresh surrogate primary key. Features with no MSOA overlap (offshore or outside England & Wales) are kept whole with NULL geography columns.
