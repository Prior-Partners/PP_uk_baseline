One row per National Trust land parcel.

**SOURCE**

- The National Trust. National Trust open data — land.

**DOCUMENTATION**

- National Trust : https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/

**SCOPE**

- 2,785 rows.

**CRS**

- EPSG:27700 (OSGB 1936 / British National Grid). Geometry type MultiPolygon.

**LICENCE**

- Open Government Licence v3.0 (confirm with the National Trust before re-publication).

**DATA QUALITY CAVEATS**

- Geography keys are NULL on 338 of 4,109 rows, measured 28 July 2026: 280 fall inside an England or Wales district and could carry one, so their keys are a gap rather than an absence; 52 are residual fragments left by the MSOA split, each under 100 sqm or 10 m; 6 fall outside every district — offshore, inter-tidal, or beyond Great Britain.
- County and Spatial Development Strategy columns are England and Wales only; rows elsewhere carry no county or SDS. Wales and the Isles of Scilly carry a county but no SDS. Rows with no Local Authority District code are NULL in all four columns.

**ENRICHMENT**

- `sds_name` / `sds_group` — Spatial Development Strategy area and devolution status, a Prior + Partners categorisation over Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) English devolution policy, joined at load on the row's Local Authority District 2025 code via uk.ref_lad25_ctyua25_sds_lu_jul2026.

**LOADED INTO uk_baseline**

- Loaded August 2024.

MSOA SPLIT (added 30 June 2026)

- Geometry split to one row per (source feature x MSOA 2021). Each row carries that MSOA's msoa21cd / msoa21nm / msoa21hclnm and best-fit lad22 / lad25. The source feature's original primary key is preserved as `source_fid`; `gid` is a fresh surrogate primary key.
- Keep-everything (3 July 2026): geometry outside every MSOA — offshore, estuarine, or beyond the generalised coastline — is retained as rows with NULL geography columns (source_fid links the parts), so the layer holds the complete source geometry.
