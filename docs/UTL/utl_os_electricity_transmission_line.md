**DEFINITIONS**

- "Cables used to supply electricity that are suspended between pylons." (OS OpenMap Local Technical Specification, ElectricityTransmissionLine)

**SCOPE**

**CRS**

- EPSG:27700 (OSGB 1936 / British National Grid). Geometry type LineString.

- OS OpenData Licence (incorporates Open Government Licence v3.0; attribution "Contains OS data (c) Crown copyright and database right" required).

MSOA SPLIT (added 4 July 2026)

- Geometry split to one row per (source feature x MSOA 2021). Each row carries that MSOA's msoa21cd / msoa21nm / msoa21hclnm and best-fit lad22 / lad25. The source feature's original primary key is preserved as `source_fid`; `gid` is a fresh surrogate primary key. Geometry outside every MSOA (offshore or outside England & Wales) is retained as rows with NULL geography columns, so the layer holds the complete source geometry.

**DATA QUALITY CAVEATS**

- The row count counts split pieces, not source features: this layer was split by Middle Layer Super Output Area, so it holds one row per feature per MSOA piece, plus whole and remainder rows to keep 100% of the source geometry. 18,043 rows represent 11,831 source features, measured 28 July 2026. `source_fid` identifies the originating feature.
- Geography keys are NULL on 1,578 of 18,043 rows, measured 28 July 2026: 370 fall inside an England or Wales district and could carry one, so their keys are a gap rather than an absence; 38 are residual fragments left by the MSOA split, each under 100 sqm or 10 m; 1,170 are in Scotland or Northern Ireland, outside the England and Wales lookup.
- County and Spatial Development Strategy columns are England and Wales only; rows elsewhere carry no county or SDS. Wales and the Isles of Scilly carry a county but no SDS. Rows with no Local Authority District code are NULL in all four columns.

**ENRICHMENT**

- `sds_name` / `sds_group` — Spatial Development Strategy area and devolution status, a Prior + Partners categorisation over Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) English devolution policy, joined at load on the row's Local Authority District 2025 code via uk.ref_lad25_ctyua25_sds_lu_jul2026.
